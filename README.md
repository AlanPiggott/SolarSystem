# SolarSystem
A site with information on the solar system.


This site helped further my understanding about flex-box and centering elements in CSS. The only problem is I need to make it responsive 
as it will only work on a full size desktop screen. The Navigation bar and some text gets distorted at smaller sizes.

Would like to add features such as utilizing nasas API.
