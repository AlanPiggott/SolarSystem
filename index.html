                <h2 id="mercury">MERCURY</h2>
                <p>Because the planet is so close to the sun, Mercury's surface temperature can reach a scorching 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius). However, since this world doesn't have much of a real atmosphere to entrap any heat, at night temperatures can plummet to minus 275 F (minus 170 C), a temperature swing of more than 1,100 degrees F (600 degree C), the greatest in the solar system. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="sun">SUN</h2>
                <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — about one million Earths could fit inside the sun. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="earth">EARTH</h2>
                <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life. Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="mars">MARS</h2>
                <p>The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps and weather and canyons and extinct volacanoes, evidence of an even more active past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
                <p>Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest planet in the solar system. It's the farthest planet from Earth that's visible to the naked human eye, but the planet's most outstanding features — its rings — are better viewed through a telescope. Although the other gas giants in the solar system — Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune —  also have rings, Saturn's rings are particularly prominent, earning it the nickname the "Ringed Planet."</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
                <p>Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the size of a basketball. Uranus is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Uranus orbits our Sun, a star, and is the seventh planet from the Sun at a distance of about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
                <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
